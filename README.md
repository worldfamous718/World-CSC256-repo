This repository belongs to World..redacted and is used for coursework in CSC256, Software Quality Assurance. The purpose of this repo is to practice setting up a proper development and testing environment while learning the fundamentals of software quality, testing strategies, and reliability in modern software systems.



The work in this repository focuses on understanding how testing tools, version control, and structured project organization contribute to higher-quality software. Emphasis is placed on learning how automated tests, documentation, and repeatable environments help reduce errors and improve maintainability. We will be using Agile sprints, so I will learn to work on a team and use different GitHub flow features.



\## Project Structure and Tools



This project uses Python with a virtual environment to ensure consistent dependencies across systems. Testing tools such as pytest and a simple web framework are included to support test-driven development concepts that will be explored throughout the course. Additional files and folders will be added as assignments progress and new quality assurance concepts are introduced.
